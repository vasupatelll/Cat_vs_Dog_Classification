# Cat vs Dog Classification

## ðŸ”Ž Project Overview:
Cat vs Dog Classification is another deep learning application which classifies the images of cats and dogs. The proposed CNN utilizes a labeled dataset in order to automate the recognition process. This project demonstrates very practical applications of deep learning in image processing and classification tasks.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Highlights:
- Dataset and Preprocessing: The project utilizes a dataset that contains a set of images of cats and dogs, which are labeled.
  
- Data preprocessing: resizing images, normalizing data, data augmentation in order to improve model generalization.
  
- Model Architecture: A CNN model was implemented using TensorFlow/Keras with multiple convolutional and pooling layers in order to extract features effectively. Dense layers were added at the end for binary classification.
  
- Training and Evaluation: Trained the model using cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer. Metrics monitored are accuracy and loss over epoch as well as visualization of training performance.
  
- Visualization and Tools: Graphs of loss and accuracy were created to check the performance and any overfitting/underfitting trend. Predictions were visualized to assess real-world applicability.

## ðŸŽ¯ Outcome
The CNN model successfully classified images of cats and dogs with high accuracy, demonstrating the power of deep learning in image classification. This project also showcases proficiency in building, training, and fine-tuning machine learning models, making it a valuable portfolio addition for showcasing expertise in AI and image processing.
